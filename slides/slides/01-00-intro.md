## Course Organisation

^

- Fast Paced!
- No Hands-On Exercises
- Basic Programming Required

Note:

6 hours to cover the basics is challenging and it makes it impossible to use
hands-on exercises. Try the provided code-sample and read them attentively.

This course assumes basic programming knowledge (loops, branches, ...)

The course also aims to get at something practical fast like reading data from
text files.
