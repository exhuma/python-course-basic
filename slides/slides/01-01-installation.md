# Installation

Python is available on all major platforms.

Go to https://www.python.org/downloads
^

### Linux


* Available by default on most Unix platforms.
* Python 2 and 3 can both happily live on the same system without interfering
  with each other (f.ex. the `python` and `python3` packages on debian and
  derivates).
* On most systems, running “python” will launch Python 2. Use `python3` to
  s tart Python 3!
^

### MacOS

* Download the `pkg` file and install.

By default, Python 2.7 is installed. Installing from the official package will
not overwrite the existing installation. They will live side-by-side.
